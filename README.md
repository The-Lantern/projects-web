# Lantern Projects

This guide will walk you through how to set up a new projects page on The Lantern's projects-web GitHub repository.

The hope is to have several pre-made templates that can be used, with maybe a little modifications, to create interactive and responsive websites for special projects at The Lantern.

## Getting started

Some things to keep in mind:

* Each new project should be created in the /projects folder and be linked to the main projects CSS and Bootstrap CSS.
* If you need to add additional styling, create a stylesheet in /css and link to HTML file. Do **NOT** change the main Lantern CSS unless updating universal styling.
* Each template includes standard building blocks, such as images, pull quotes, Ad blocks and the donation jumbotron. These blocks should be copied and pasted and updated with URLs, text, etc.
